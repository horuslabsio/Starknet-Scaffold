## USAGE

### Contract Section

The `contract` folder contains all the tools needed to write, build, test and deploy your Starknet smart contracts. It is built with Scarb and Starknet Foundry. Here are common operations you can perform on your contracts:

#### Build contracts

To build your smart contracts, from the base repository run:

```
npm run build-contracts
```

#### Format contracts

Scarb comes with an in-built cairo formatter. To utilize it run:

```
npm run format-contracts
```

#### Verify contracts

To verify your smart contracts, from the base repository run:

```
npm run verify-contracts --contract-address=<CONTRACT_ADDRESS> --contract-name=<CONTRACT_NAME> --network=<NETWORK>
```

#### Test contracts

To run your tests:

```
npm run test-contracts
```

#### Run custom starknet foundry scripts

To run a custom starknet foundry deploy/declare/invoke script:

```
npm run contract-scripts <SCRIPT_NAME> --url=<RPC_URL>
```

#### Generate an SRC-5 interface ID for your contracts

To generate an interface ID, run:

```
npm run generate-interface <PATH_TO_INTERFACE>
```

#### Prepare Account for deployment

To prepare your account for deployment, run:

```
npm run prepare-account --url=<RPC_URL> --name=<ACCOUNT_NAME> <PROFILE_NAME>
```

generates a profile which is added to `scarb.toml` and can be passed to other commands.

#### Deploy Account

To deploy an account:

```
npm run deploy-account --profile=<MY_PROFILE> --name=<ACCOUNT_NAME> --feetoken=<FEE_TOKEN> --maxfee=<MAX_FEE>
```

where the `profile` is gotten from `snfoundry.toml`, `name` is the prepared account and `maxfee` is the specified max fee.

#### Delete Account

To delete an account:

```
npm run delete-account --profile=<MY_PROFILE> --accountfile=<PATH_TO_ACCOUNT_FILE> --name=<ACCOUNT_NAME> --network=<alpha-mainnet | alpha-goerli>
```

#### Declare Contract

To declare a contract:

```
npm run declare-contract --profile=<MY_PROFILE> --contract=<CONTRACT_NAME> --feetoken=<FEE_TOKEN>
```

#### Deploy Contract

To deploy a contract:

```
npm run deploy-contract --profile=<MY_PROFILE> --feetoken=<FEE_TOKEN> --class=<CONTRACT_CLASSHASH>
```

#### Run Starknet-Devnet

Ensure to have Docker installed. To run starknet-devnet:

```
npm run devnet
```

### Dojo Section

The `dojo-contracts` folder contains all the tools needed to write, build, test and dojo projects. It is built with sozo and katana. Here are common operations you can perform on your dojo contracts.

#### Initialize Dojo Project

To initialize a dojo project, from the base repository:

```
npm run initialize-dojo --name=<PROJECT_NAME>
```

#### Build Dojo Project

To build your dojo project, from the base repository run:

```
npm run build-dojo --name=<PROJECT_NAME>
```

### Deploy Katana

To build deploy katana, from the base repository run:

```
npm run deploy-dojo-katana --name=<PROJECT_NAME>
```

#### Migrate Dojo Project

To migrate your dojo project, from the base repository run:

```
npm run migrate-dojo --name=<PROJECT_NAME>
```

### UI SECTION

The `frontend` section contains all UI components. Built using NextJS, Starknet.js, Starknet-React, Starknetkit, and Typescript.

#### Run UI

To run UI, from the base repository:

```
npm run start
```

#### Build UI

To build your frontend, from the base repository run:

```
